An examination of Airbnb listings in Tibet and East Turkestan.

The single notebook file contains the output of the data analysis work looking at Airbnb listings in Chinese occupied Tibet and East Turkestan (governed as Xinjiang).

The supporting JSON and CSV files are too large to download and the shapefiles are licenced (links to the sources are contained in the document).
